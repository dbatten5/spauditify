Spotify playlist auditing.

## Motivation

I have 4 downtempo playlists on Spotify at varying levels of energy, from most
energetic (Apr√®slist) to least energetic (Sheep). I know that some of the tracks
in certain playlists don't belong there because they're either too energetic or
not energetic enough. For a while now I've been meaning to go through the
playlists and sort them out but since they have over 1000 tracks combined it's
been a bit of a daunting task. Enter: *data*. Using the Spotify API and
statistical analysis, I attempt to build a program that will sort out my
playlists for me.
